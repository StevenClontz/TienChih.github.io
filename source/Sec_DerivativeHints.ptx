  <title>Hints when Differentating</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
     Here, we list some suggestions to keep in mind when working with dervatives.

    <title>Simplify</title>
    <p>
     If one finds onself differentating a complex expression such as <m>f(x)=\frac{20x^5\sqrt{x^2+2x+1}}{x^3}</m>.  One may be tempted to charge right in and use the quotient, chain and product rules to resolve.  But notice that:
     <md>
        <mrow>f(x)\amp = \frac{20x^5\sqrt{x^2+2x+1}}{x^3}</mrow>
       <mrow>\amp = 20x^2\sqrt{x^2+2x+1}</mrow>
       <mrow>\amp = 20x^2\sqrt{(x+1)^2}</mrow>
       <mrow>\amp = 20x^2(x+1)</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp = 20x^3+20x</mrow>
        <mrow>f'(x)\amp = 60x^2+20</mrow>
      </md>.
      Much nicer.

    <title>Take it slow</title>
Go through the steps one at a time.  A problem could invoke multiple rules.  Take care to not exactly where and how each rule applies.

    <title>Does it make sense?</title>
Sketch the function you are differentiating, by hand in Desmos, or your favourite method.  When you find the derivative, compare it to your sketch.  Are the rates of change actually reflected by your proposed derivative?

    <title>We don't live in the Stone Age</title>

<p>Technology is a wonderful thing.  We can not only verify our derivatives algebraically, but graphically as well.</p>
<p> If <m>f(x)=\frac{x^3\ln(x^2+1)}{e^x}</m>, and were to find <m>f'(x)</m>,  we may use technology to aid us.

      <sage>
        <input>
          f(x)=(x^3*ln(x^2+1))/e^x
          diff(f(x))
        </input>
        <output>
        </output>
      </sage>
      We see that <m>f'(x)=-x^3e^{-x}\ln(x^2+1)+\frac{2x^4e^{-x}}{x^2+1}+ 3x^2e^{-x}\ln(x^2 + 1)</m>.  Then graphically:
