<p>The first fallacy we discuss is the <dfn class="terminology">Fallacy of the Converse</dfn>.  The Fallacy of the Converse takes an implication \(p\to q\) and then argues that if \(q\) is true than \(p\) must be true as well.</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
\begin{array}{l}
p\to q \\
q\\
\hline
p
\end{array}
\end{equation*}

<p data-braille="continuation">So for example "If I sell this TV, I will have $200.  I have $200, so I must have sold the TV."  The reason this is a fallacy is because, absent more information, you could have acquired $200 in any other way, it was never suggested that this is your only avenue to have acquired this money.  Recall that both \(F\to T, T\to T\) are true statements, so knowing that \(q\) is true, does not allow you to conclude automatically that \(p\) is true.</p>
