<p>Suppose that during the zombie apocalypse, an anti-zombification serum is developed.  People who take the serum have a 10% chance of becoming zombies, but those who don't have an 85% chance of becoming zombies. Suppose half of a city is zombified.</p>
<ol class="decimal">
<li>What proportion of the city took the serum?</li>
<li>If you weren't zombified, what is the probability you took the serum?</li>
</ol>
