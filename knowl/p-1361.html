<p>What this means is that the Central Limit Theorem won't apply to any old random variable you find lying around.  But when you collect data, it's rarely clear if the data you collect from is something with defined mean and deviation or not.  These sort of distributions often seem well behaved but are subject to high volativity that only reveals itself upon large number of data points, as seen above.  These are often dismissed as outliers!</p>
