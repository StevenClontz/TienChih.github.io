<p>Random samples generally speaking are difficult to obtain.  If you wanted to say poll your local congressional district about upcoming candidates, how one conducts the poll can have a huge impact on who actually responds to it.  A phone survey who calls landlines will be biased for people who have landlines and don't use mobile phones primarily, for example.  An internet poll could be biased on where the poll appears and who frequents such sites, as well as biased torwards those who are more likely to be online than others.</p>
