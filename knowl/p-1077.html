<p>A company has two plants producing vehicles, plants \(A\) and \(B\text{.}\)  In plant \(A\text{,}\) 85% of the vehicles pass inspection, and in plant \(B\) only 70% do.  Suppose plant \(A\) produces 60% of the vehicles, and plant \(B\) the other 40%.</p>
<ol class="decimal">
<li>What percent of the vehicles produced are from plant \(A\) and pass inspection?</li>
<li>What percent of the vehicles produced are from plant \(B\) and pass inspection?</li>
<li>What percent of the vehicles produced pass inspection?</li>
<li>If a vehicle passes inspection, what's the probability it was manufactured in plant \(A\text{?}\)</li>
