<p>Well, we know that given every possible output from the objective function \(f\) i.e.Â every possible \(k\) so that \(x+y=k\text{,}\) this actually defines a line: \url{https://www.desmos.com/calculator/qststwgxro}. In the link you can see the line when \(k=0\text{.}\) There is one point \((0,0)\) which is actually a part of our region which would give this output. As we drag \(k\) upwards, we see that there is a line segment worth of points in our region which would give that \(k\) as an output. At \(k=4\) \url{https://www.desmos.com/calculator/iy5rq5hpxa} we hit a corner of the region but we see that we can still increase \(k\text{.}\) Now at \(k=6\) \url{https://www.desmos.com/calculator/qwrti1mxln}, we see that we've hit another corner. Very importantly, if we try to increase \(k\) at all, our line will fall outside of the feasible region and there will be no points that would give such a \(k\) as an output.</p>
