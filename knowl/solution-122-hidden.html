<p>There are several approaches. You only need to go through one of these to obtain answer.  Let \(M\) denote being a Math major and \(A\) denote getting an A.</p>
<p>First note that \(P(M)=0.1\) and \(P(M|A)=\frac{0.03}{0.3}=0.1\text{.}\)  These are  the same (your chances of being a Math major is unaffected by whether you got an A) so these are  independent.</p>
<p>Next note that \(P(A)=0.3\) and \(P(A|M)=\frac{0.03}{0.1}=0.3\text{.}\)  These are  the same (your chances of getting an A is unaffected by whether you were a Math major) so these are  independent.</p>
<p>Finally note that \(P(M)=0.1, P(A)=0.3, P(M\cap A)=0.03\) so \(P(M)P(A)=0.1\cdot 0.3=0.03P(M\cap A)\text{.}\)  So these are  independent.</p>
