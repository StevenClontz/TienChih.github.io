<p>For algebraic expressions like the ones above, \(x\) can take on infinitely many values, so we can't just sit there and plug in infinitely many values into both sides, so it becomes imperative that we establish some sort of general rules and laws, like distribution, to avoid having to do this, while still being able to meaningfully accomplish things. The nice thing about logical statements is that for any variable, we only have 2 possible values, \(T\) or \(F\text{.}\) The statement itself can only take on the values \(T\) or \(F\text{,}\) so it's much easier to see if two logical statements are equivalent, compared to algebraic ones.</p>
