<p>In <a href="Sec_AvgRoC.html" class="internal" title="Section 7.2: Average rates of change">SectionÂ 7.2</a>, we discuss average rates of change over intervals.  But typically, when rates of change are discussed, it's not described in terms of periods of time but at the very moment.  What is the speed right now?  Not what is the average speed?  How fast is the temperature rising?  How quickly is the Dow falling?  These are all described as <em class="emphasis">instantaneous</em> rates of change.  In other words, rates of change as the interval over which they are defined tends to zero.</p>
