<p>Suppose that a agriculture student is raising goats and pigs for a project. The goal is to raise some animals and then sell them for profit. She can raise a total of at most 16 animals. It costs $25 per goat and $ 75 per pig, and she has a budget of $900. Finally, she doesn't particularly like goats, so she won't raise more than 10 of them. If the profit per goat is $12 and profit per pig is $40, how many of each should she raise to maximize profits?</p>
<p>We should note, if \(x\) is the number of goats and \(y\) the number of pigs, then she is maximizing \(P(x,y)=12x+40y\text{.}\) The inequalities she is dealing with are:</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{align*}
x+y\amp \leq\amp 16\ \ \text{ at most 16 animals }\\
25x+75y\amp \leq\amp 900\ \ \text{ \dollar900 budget }\\
x\amp \leq\amp 10\ \ \text{ hates goats }\\
x\amp \geq\amp 0\ \ \text{ no negative goats }\\
y\amp \geq\amp 0\ \ \text{ no negative pigs }
\end{align*}
</div>
<p>Sketching our region out we get: \url{https://www.desmos.com/calculator/lwbkvibuyq}, with corner points:</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
\begin{array}{c|c|c} x \amp  y \amp  P(x,y)\\ \hline 0 \amp  0 \amp  12(0)+40(0)=0\\ 10 \amp  0 \amp  12(10)+40(0)=120\\ 10 \amp  6 \amp  12(10)+40(6)=360\\ 6 \amp  10 \amp  12(6)+40(10)=472\\ 0 \amp  12 \amp  12(0)+40(12)=480 \end{array}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>So the profit is maximized when you raise 12 pigs and no goats. To get a better sense of how we found these corners, these are just system of \(2\times 2\) systems of equations: \url{https://www.desmos.com/calculator/bzczxrkggy}</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="Sec_LinearOptimization.html#example-33">in-context</a></span>
