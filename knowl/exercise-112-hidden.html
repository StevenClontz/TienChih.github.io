<body><article class="exercise exercise-like"><p>Suppose you have a bizzare compound stored a chamber with different areas with different temperatures and pressures.  Thus it is always changing between the 3 states of matter.  After each hour, 20% of any solid becomes liquid and 20%  of the solid becomes gas.  10% of liquids become solid and 30% becomes gas.  15% of gas becomes solid and 40% becomes liquid.  What are initial amounts of solid liquid and gas so the amount of each never changes?</p>
