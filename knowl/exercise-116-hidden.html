<body><article class="exercise exercise-like"><p>Farida opens a restaurant, the food is good, but the restaurant business is notoriously tough.  She needs a positive critic review in local press to generate the local buzz she needs to survive.  Each month, there is a 30% chance a critic reviews the restaurant.  There's a 10% chance that otherwise she breaks even that month. If that fails, she dips into her savings.  She can do so 5 times before the business is bankrupt.</p>
<p>What is the probability she gets the review before she goes bankrupt?</p>
