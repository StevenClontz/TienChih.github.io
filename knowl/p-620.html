<p>Up until this point, we have discussed one time loans or investments.  But the fact is that most loans and investments aren't made or paid off in single lump sums.  You may purchase a car or a vehicle, and then slowly pay off that debt over time.  Maybe you're lucky enough to recieve an inheritance in an account that you slowly draw money from until it is depleted.  Maybe you make regular payments into a retirement or rainy day fund until a certain date or time is reached.</p>
