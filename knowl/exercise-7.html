<p>Bountiful Boats has to produce at least 5000 cabin cruisers and 12,000 pontoons each year; they can produce at most 30,000 jet skis in a year. The company has two factories:  one in Michigan, and one in Wisconsin; each factory is open for a maximum of 240 days per year. The Michigan factory makes 20 cabin cruisers, 40 pontoons, and 60 jet skis per day. The Wisconsin factory makes 10 cruisers, 30 pontoons, and 50 jet skis per day. The cost to run the Michigan factory per day is $960,000; the cost to run the Wisconsin factory per day is $750,000. How many days of the year should each factory run in order to meet the boat production, yet do so at a minimum cost?</p>
