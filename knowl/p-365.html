<p>Something thats often misunderstood about Math is that people think that Math is the study of numbers. This is false, and not even historically justifiable. Certainly numeracy has taken on a great role within mathematics, but that is not fundamentally what the discipline is. Really, even when Math deals with numbers, the fundamental thing that is studied are not numbers but <dfn class="terminology">statements</dfn>. What is a statement? It is a sentence that is true or false, but not both. For example:</p>
<ol class="decimal">
<li><p>MSU-Billings is a State School.</p></li>
<li><p>\(10+5=12\text{.}\)</p></li>
<li><p>\(x\lt 4\text{.}\)</p></li>
</ol>
