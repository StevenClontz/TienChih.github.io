<p>Now this part is sometimes tricky for students, but bear with me. If your kid doesn't clean their room, you can do whatever you want. You only said that you would do something if they cleaned their room, you made no promises as to what you would do if they didn't. So now whether or not you buy them ice-cream, you've technically kept your promise. This may make you a pushover parent, depending, but it wouldn't make you a liar.</p>
