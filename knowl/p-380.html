<p>So we're going to be doing something in this chapter that seems fairly strange. We are going to be working with variables that are placeholders for statements rather than numbers. The possible values for these statements then, are “True” and “False”. We will be performing operations on these statements as in standard algebra, but since every variable has only 2 possible values, the rules of our algebra are going to be different.</p>
