<p>The \(\exists\) pronounced “there exists” or “there is” indicates the following statement is true for some values of \(x\text{.}\) It could be true for 1 of them, or a bunch of them, or for all of them. The only thing we know for sure is that there is AT LEAST 1 value of \(x\) for which it is true. So \(\exists I(x)\) would mean “There is an MSUB student who likes Ice Cream.” or “At least one MSUB student likes Ice Cream.”</p>
