<p>This follows intuitively.  If at a resturaunt, 20% of people order steak (\(P(S)=0.2\)) and half the people who order steak order fries (\(P(F|S)=0.5\)), then how many people order fries and steak?  It's \(P(F\cap S)=P(F|S)P(S)=(0.5)(0.2)=0.1\) or 10% of the patrons had both steak and fries.  But without all of the formal symbolism, if 20 people out of a 100 had steak, and half also had fries, then 10 our of 100 had steak and fries!</p>
