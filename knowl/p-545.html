<p>So looking at any exponential function, but specifically for increasing ones, we notice that they are 1-1, meaning two different inputs give you 2 different outputs. Thus, \(f(x)=a^x\) is an invertible function. You can see in these graphs \url{https://www.desmos.com/calculator/cvriy608bg} that reflecting the exponential over the \(y=x\) line giving us the green function is another function. We call this function \(\log_a(x)\text{.}\) As the inverse of an exponential function, it has some properties:</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li><p><dfn class="terminology">It's domain is only positive numbers</dfn>. Why? Because the only possible outputs of exponential outputs are positive numbers. Taking the inverse reverses the roles of the domain and range, and so the domain of \(\log_a\) is the positives.</p></li>
<li><p><dfn class="terminology">As \(\mathbf{x}\) goes to 0, \(\mathbf{\log_a(x)}\) goes to \(\mathbf{-\infty}\text{.}\)</dfn> This is the result of the reflection. Normally \(a^x\) (for \(a&gt;1\)) goes to 0 as \(x\to -\infty\text{,}\) so when reflected, that line is now asymptotic to the \(y\)-axis. Also \(\log_a\) returns the power necessary to achieve the value \(x\text{.}\) If \(x\) is a small number like 0.0001, what power would I have to raise \(a\) to to get \(0.0001\text{?}\) It can't be 0, \(a^0=1\text{,}\) so it has to be <dfn class="terminology">less</dfn> than 0, and the smaller \(x\) is, the lower this power must go.</p></li>
<li><p>As \(\mathbf{x\to\infty, \log_a(x)\to \infty}\text{,}\) again this is the result of the reflection, but we can also think of this as the powers \(a\) needs to be raised to in order to achieve \(x\text{,}\) as this increases, those powers must increase as well.</p></li>
<li>
<p>\(\log_a(xy)=\log_a(x)+\log_a(y)\text{.}\) Too see this consider:</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{align*}
xy\amp =\amp a^{\log_a{xy}}\\
xy\amp =\amp x\cdot y\\
\amp =\amp a^{\log_a(x)}\cdot a^{\log_a(y)}\\
\amp =\amp a^{\log_a(x)+\log_a(y)}\text{.}
\end{align*}
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>\(\log_a(x^y)=y\log_a(x)\text{.}\) To see this, consider:</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{align*}
x^y\amp =\amp a^{\log_a(x^y)}.\\
x^y\amp =\amp (a^{\log_a(x)})^y\\
\amp =\amp a^{y\log_a(x)}
\end{align*}
</div>
</li>
</ul>
