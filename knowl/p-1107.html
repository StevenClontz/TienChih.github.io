<p>Recall <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/ExercisePlants.html" title="Checkpoint 8.3.15">Checkpoint 8.3.15</a>, if we rename our events, let \(Y\) denote “built in plant A” and \(X\) denotes “passes inspection”, then we have \(P(X|Y)=0.85, P(X|Y^c)=0.7\) measure the 85% chance for vehicles built in plant A to pass inspection, and the 70% built in B to pass inspection.  Then, how many vehicles pass inspection depends entirely on how many vehicles are manufactured in A as opposed to B. <iframe src="https://www.desmos.com/calculator/a4gs4jrer2" id="interactive-173" width="600" height="600"></iframe> If 100% of the vehicles were built in plant A, then naturally 85% of cars would pass inspection.  If they were all built in B, then only 70% would pass inspection.  For any mix of plants A and B, the number who pass inspection should be something in between.</p>
