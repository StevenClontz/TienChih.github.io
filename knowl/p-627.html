<p>So this means that in \(0\) seconds, the change in the height was \(f'(0)=-10(0)+20=20\) meters/second as we suspected! But now we can compute all the other instantaneous rates of change as well. So at \(t=1\) second, it'll be \(f'(1)=-10(1)+20=10\) meters per second. In 2 seconds we are at the top with \(f'(2)=0\) meters per second, at 3 seconds, \(f'(3)=-10\) meters/second to reflect the negative change in height at this point. Finally in 4 seconds, the rocket hits the ground at \(f'(4)=-20\) meters per second. (drag \(a\) around and see for yourself! \url{https://www.desmos.com/calculator/3po0qezgel})</p>
