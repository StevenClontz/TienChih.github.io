<p>What we now mean is every pair \((x,y)\) that make THIS statement true. So that would include every point on the line \(2x+3y=12\text{,}\) as well as say \((0,0), (1,2), (1,3)\) but not \((1,4)\) (plug them in to see why.) Obviously, just like in lines, we don't want to test every one of infinitely many points to see what's going on.</p>
