<body><article class="exercise exercise-like"><p>Suppose employees of a company go through a probationary period when hired.  They are evaluated regularly and rated unacceptable, in progress, good, and excellent.  Unacceptable employees are let go, and excellent employees are offered full time contracts, either way they are no longer probationary.</p>
<p>In progress employees have a 20% chance of moving to unacceptable, 20% chance of moving to good, and a 10% chance of moving to excellent in each round of review.  Good employees have a 10% chance to move to unacceptable, 20% chance of moving to in progress, and a 30% chance of moving to excellent.</p>
<ol class="decimal">
<li>Find the solution matrix.</li>
<li>If an employee came in as in progress, what is the probability they get a full time contract?</li>
<li>If an employee comes in as good, how long on average is their probationary period?</li>
</ol>
