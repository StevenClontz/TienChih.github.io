<p>Finite Mathematics in general is an odd course.  The purpose of such courses is to give a broad background of useful and relevant mathematics within a single course.  This book does not assume any prerequisite in any collegiate level mathematics.  Since such courses tend to move through many subjects in a short amount of time, it is a challenege to see how best to present ideas and content in a concise manner.  This led to the choice to embrace technology to simplify much of the drudgery and tedium of computation.  Thus Sage, R and Desmos interactives are liberally used to automate certain computational details, leaving students and instructors free to focus on ideas and concepts.</p>
