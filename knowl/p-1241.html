<p>For our above English test taking student, if she has a 30% chance of getting an A, wouldn't we <em class="emphasis">expect</em> that 30% of her tests turn out to be A's?  If someone had a 90% free-throw percentage and they shot 20 times, wouldn't we <em class="emphasis">expect</em> \(0.9(20)=18\) shots to make it?  There's a similar way of viewing variance which is beyond the scope of this text, but we can still see that both are totally determined by \(n\) and \(p\text{.}\)</p>
