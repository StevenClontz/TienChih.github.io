<p>Suppose that a test for a virus has a 90% chance of returning a positive result if a person is infected with the virus, but a 8% chance of returning a positive result if not infected.  Suppose that people are randomly tested and 30% of the tests are coming back positive.  If Andre went out, took the test and it came back positive, what is the probability he has been infected?</p>
