<p>Find \((x,y)\) such that:</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{align*}
2x+3y\amp \leq\amp 12\\
x\amp \geq\amp 0\\
y\amp \geq\amp 0
\end{align*}
</div>
<p data-braille="continuation">and \(f(x,y)=x+y\) is maximized.</p>
<p>From above, we know that this region is a triangle in the first quadrant. We want to find the point(s) in this region where by taking the sum of the points, we get as large as a value as possible. There are infinitely many points in this region, how are we ever going to find the one that makes this sum the largest?</p>
<p>Well, we know that given every possible output from the objective function \(f\) i.e.Â every possible \(k\) so that \(x+y=k\text{,}\) this actually defines a line: \url{https://www.desmos.com/calculator/qststwgxro}. In the link you can see the line when \(k=0\text{.}\) There is one point \((0,0)\) which is actually a part of our region which would give this output. As we drag \(k\) upwards, we see that there is a line segment worth of points in our region which would give that \(k\) as an output. At \(k=4\) \url{https://www.desmos.com/calculator/iy5rq5hpxa} we hit a corner of the region but we see that we can still increase \(k\text{.}\) Now at \(k=6\) \url{https://www.desmos.com/calculator/qwrti1mxln}, we see that we've hit another corner. Very importantly, if we try to increase \(k\) at all, our line will fall outside of the feasible region and there will be no points that would give such a \(k\) as an output.</p>
<p>So, it must be that the largest \(k\) can be is 6, and that this happens at \((6,0)\text{.}\) One can check to see that this point satisfies all the criteria above. Most importantly though: <dfn class="terminology">IT MEANS TO FIND OPTIMAL SOLUTIONS ONE JUST NEEDS TO FIND THE CORNERS OF THE REGION</dfn>. This is because if your line isn't on a corner, you can still slide that value up or down, so the corresponding \(k\) value is neither maximal or minimal.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="Sec_LinearOptimization.html#example-30">in-context</a></span>
