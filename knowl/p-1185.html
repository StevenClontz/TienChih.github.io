<p>Up to this point, we have mostly focused on the probability of specific events. In this section, we take a step back and look at the experiment itself.  Certainly, if I have a jar with 5 red and 7 blue balls and draw 3 without replacement, there is a chance that I get 2 red balls.  But now we want to ask, what number of red balls are more or less likely?  On average, how many red balls would I get?  How varied are the results?</p>
