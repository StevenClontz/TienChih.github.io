<p>Suppose that in a Mathematics department, 20% of the students have done undergraduate research, 25% have gone to conferences.  We also have that 30% have done either one or the other.</p>
<ol class="decimal">
<li>What is the proportion of students who have done both undergraduate research and gone to conferences?</li>
<li>What is the proportion of students who have gone to conferences but without having done undergraduate research?</li>
<li>What is the proportion of students have neither done undergraduate research nor gone to a conference?</li>
