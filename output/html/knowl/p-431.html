<p>And we see that these things have the same truth values and are equivalent statements. But, more importantly, consider what \(\sim p \vee q\) would mean in our example. ``Either you don't clean your room or you can have ice-cream." One might rephrase this as ``You can either not clean your room or you can have ice-cream." Isn't this basically saying “If you clean your room you can have ice-cream?” So that definitely sounds like an equivalent statement to me.</p>
