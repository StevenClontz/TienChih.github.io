<p>A new airline has recently purchased a fleet of Airbus A330-300s, Boeing 767-300ERs, and Boeing Dreamliner 787-9s to meet an estimated demand for 9,300 seats. The A330-300s seat 330 passengers and cost $250 million each, the 767-300ERs seat 270 passengers and cost $200 million each, while the 787-9s seat 240 passengers and cost $250 million each. The total cost of the fleet, which had twice as many 787-9s as 767s, was $8,100 million. How many of each type of aircraft did the company purchase?</p>
