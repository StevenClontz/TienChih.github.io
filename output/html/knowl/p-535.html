<p>Special cases of logs are log base 10 which is usually just denoted \(\log\) and log based \(e\text{,}\) which is denoted \(\ln\text{.}\) Astronomers and other scientists like \(\log\) since taking \(\log\) base 10 gives you approximate magnitude of stuff. As a mathematician, I prefer \(\ln\) since \(e\) has pretty special mathematical properties, plus it's shorter, which makes it better.</p>
