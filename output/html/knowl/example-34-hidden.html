<body><article class="example example-like"><p>If I drink coffee, I will be happy. If I drink coffee, I will be wired. If I am happy, then I am wired.</p>
<p>So let:</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li><p>\(c=\) “drink coffee.”</p></li>
<li><p>\(h=\) “be happy.”</p></li>
<li><p>\(w=\) “be wired.”</p></li>
</ul>
<p>What we have is \(c\to h, c\to w\text{.}\) But there's nothing here to connect \(h\) to \(w\text{.}\) If we knew this person drank coffee, we could make that conclusion, but since we don't know that, if we knew that they were happy, it could be for some reason other than drinking coffee. So we have no idea whether or not they'd be wired as well. So we cannot conclude \(h \to w\) and this is NOT a valid argument.</p></article></body>
