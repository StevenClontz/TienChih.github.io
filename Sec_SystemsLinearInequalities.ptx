  <title>Systems of Linear Inequalities</title>
  <p>
    If a solution to a system of equations is a set of points that make several equations true,
    then the same is true of systems of linear inequalities.
    It's just going to be the collection of points that make all the inequalities true.
  </p>
  <example>
    <statement>
      <p>
        What is the solution to the following system:
        <md>
          <mrow>2x+3y\amp \leq 12</mrow>
          <mrow>x\amp \geq 0</mrow>
          <mrow>y\amp \geq 0</mrow>
        </md>
      </p>
      <p>
        We know from earlier that the solutions have to lie in the bottom right hand of the plane on or below the line <m>2x+3y=12</m>.
        We also know that neither the <m>x</m> or <m>y</m> values can be negative.
        What's left is a sort of triangle:
        <interactive desmos="2dekmagipa"  />
        This is the overlap of regions where all 3 inequalities are true.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is easier to see this region by nesting the inequalities as follows:
        <interactive desmos="apmcey4kfa"  />
      </p>
    </statement>
