  <title>Linear Programming</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      In this chapter, we introduce the notion of Linear Inequalities and Linear Optimization (or Linear Programming).
      The goal is to solve maximization and minimization problems, subject to bounds.  For example, a company with limited raw materials tries to decide on which goods to produce to maximize profit, or a nutritionist tries to find a meal that satisfied certain nutrional requirements while minimizing the number of ingredients used.  This will be the type of problem we will solve!
